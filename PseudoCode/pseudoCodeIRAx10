*IR is positioned on the front center of the robot, at the bottom of the inside of the plexiglass by the sweeper

WITH BUTTON SENSOR:

FOR RED:
(1) The Robot is aimed at the white line at about a 45 degree angle from the wall towards the white line.
(2) When it reaches 90 (or a determined encoder distance), drive backward at 0.3 power
(3) As soon as the robot sees white, STOP (with safety time limit)
(4) Overshoot line with the distance between the sensor and the center of the robot (7 inch ish ??)
(5) Spin CCW until white line
(6) Move backward a tested distance
(7) Line follow until right and left sensors are pressed
(8) Move backward another set distance
(9) Rotate 45 degrees CCW
(10) Move forward a tested distance
(11) Rotate 45 degrees CW
(12) Move forward another set distance
(13) deploy climbers
