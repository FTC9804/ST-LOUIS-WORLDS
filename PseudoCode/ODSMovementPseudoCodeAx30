* 4-22-16 @ 5:18 pm by Etienne L. --made new auto movement plan/pseudo code for auto as of 4-22-16 @ 5:18

~~~~SETUP_(VERSION Tx21)~~~~
* (1) left side of the robot is in the middle of second full tile from mountain


~~~~~~~~~MOVEMENT Ax30 (BLUE!!!)~~~~~~~~~
*Continue using setup version Tx21
* (1) Record angle
* (2) Drive backwards 1 full tile (24 inches)
* (3) Rotate 45ยบ clockwise
* (4) Drive backwards until white line is seen w/ left (driving backwards) ODS sensor
* (5) Record angle
* (6) Drive backwards for estimated distance of 6.8 inches at which point the left tread is on the white
* (7) spin another -45 degrees or global -90 or 45 degrees clockwise (all synonymous)
* (8) Now begin the loop (sub-steps)
    ## move forwards 6 inches (a big value for the first test)
    ## spin counter-clockwise with three different "OR" conditionals
        -> TIME
        -> WHITE LINE DETECTED
        -> 20 DEGREES REACHED
    ## If line is detected within the 20 degrees delta and time constraint, repeat loop
    ## Else if the line is not detected anymore because you have gone past the white line, go backwards 6 inches and start new loop:
        >> move forwards one inch (small distance for precise check)
        >> spin counter-clockwise with the same three or constraints (TIME, WHITE LINE DETECTED, 20 DEGREES REACHED )
        >> If line is detected within the 20 degrees delta and time constraint, repeat loop
        >> Else if the line is not detected, we know we are at the end of the line so exit loop
(9) Move forward one inch and spin counter clockwise until white line is seen.
(10) ACORN line follow for 20 (estimate) inches
(11) stop and score climbers
(12) code complete

Some Notes:

-When parallel to the white line the angle delta to white line should be between ***5 and 10*** degrees. If you have
 gone ***20*** degrees you have definitely missed the line entirely.
