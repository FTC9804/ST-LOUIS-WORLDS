/*
 * FTC Team 9804 Bomb Squad -- Autonomous
 * Made by the programmers of FTC Team 9804 Bomb Squad

 * Ax00 4-25-16 at 6:45 pm Etienne -- made Ax00 for start with left side of robot anywhere within the first 1/2 tile
 * Ax


 * ~~~~SETUP_(TEETH 1-5)~~~~
 * (1) Left side of the robot can be placed between first one half tile from the mountain perpendicular to the wall


 * ~~~~~~~~~MOVEMENT Ax41 (BLUE!!!)~~~~~~~~~
 * -All the steps correspond to actual steps in the op mode
 * -Continue using setup version Tx21
 * (0) Disable all servo controllers so that they are not draining energy while the robot is powered
 * (1) Drive straight backwards from wall at a 0 degree angle. (When initializing the gyro, 0 degrees is set)
 * (2) spin move clockwise 45ยบ
 * (3) drive straight backwards high speed for 72 inches
 * (4) drive until white line is seen at medium-low speed
 * (5) overshoot by 6.8 inches
 * (6) spin move clockwise 45ยบ (global position is now -90ยบ)
 * (7) enter loop for checking if we are next to white line; exit when time runs out or we are no longer next to line
 * (7.1) drive forwards 4 inches (away from the beacon)
 * (7.2) spin counter clockwise until line is seen or we reach a maximum angle
 * (7.3) spin clockwise back to global heading of -90ยบ
 * ***NOW THE ROBOT IS SLIGHTLY BEYOND THE TIP OF THE WHITE LINE*** (facing the beacon)
 * (8) drive straight backwards 4 inches
 * (9) spin move counter clockwise until white line is detected, back to earlier position
 * (10) ACORN proportional line follow for 15 inches
 * (10.5) enable the servo controller that hosts the shelterDrop servo
 * (11) score shelter drop
 * (12) code complete!
 *
 * NOTES:
 *      -> This auto program uses a variable called "CHECK_FOR_WHITE_LINE_FORWARDS_DISTANCE."
 *      -> This auto program also uses the idle wheel for accurate encoder measurements to prevent backlash
 *      -> This means that this auto program uses CHECK_FOR_WHITE_LINE_FORWARDS_DISTANCE for the forwards value when checking
 *          and the value for going backwards once we exit the loop. In this auto, THE SECOND DISTANCE IS NOT GREATER!!!!
 *
 * GENERAL RULE:
 * FWD: leftPower = midPower - driveSteering;
 * BWD: leftPower = midPower + drive Steering
 * CCW: positive
 * CW: negative
 * Heading = ABSOLUTE heading of the robot on the field
 * Distance = INCREMENTAL distance of the robot on the field
 *
 * referencing floorODS in this program call values from ods1, which is the ODS on the left side of the robot, used when blue
 *
 * ACORN = adjusted center of rotation navigation; we use this for our proportional line follow because our ODS sensors are off centered
